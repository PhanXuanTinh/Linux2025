I used execl() but this error appeared:

Run with environment variable = 1
ACTION=1 ./BUILD/app
execl failed
: No such file or directory
<Parent process> The child process end

How to fix:
- Option 1: Use execlp() instead of execl()
- Option 2: Use absolute path: /bin/ls

==================================================
exec() does not create a new process.

It replaces the entire content of the current program.

The PID remains unchanged.

If exec succeeds → the code after exec is never executed.

If exec fails → the program continues executing the code after exec.
